This is meant to be a first person walk-through portfolio project. 

Use WASD keys to move and the mouse to look around. Go around the maze following the arrows on the walls until 
you see the "Thank you for playing" texture. There should be a video playing by the "work experiance" texture.

It takes a while of serving the page for the browser to start playing the video. 

The textures for the walls were either made using HTML and CSS, or just screenshots from my local machine. The code for the HTML textures is located in the "textures" folder. 

The pattern on the floor was taken off the THREE.js website but everything else was written by me (lighting, walls, wall texture, etc.)
