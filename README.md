This is meant to be a first person walk-through portfolio project. Use WASD keys to move and the mouse to look around. Go around the maze following the arrows on the walls until 
you see the "Thank you for playing" texture. There should be a video playing by the "work experiance" texture. You might have to
wait a little bit for it to start playing.
